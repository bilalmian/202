	<p>The first assignment proved challenging when first assigned because of how little experience I had with PHP. After completing the exercises in class and studying the videos you have provided for us 
	my understanding of PHP has increases significantly. The videos provided helped me finish the code aspect of the project earlier than expected leaving me time to use styles to change the aesthetics
of my project making it more appealing. Overall this project helped me get my feet with with PHP so to speak and has made me develop an interest in the back end programming of web applications </p><br>
